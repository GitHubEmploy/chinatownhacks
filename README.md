# Chinatown Hacks

## What is it?

- ChinatownHacks is a high-school level hackathon hosted in San Francisco for the first time ever this year.

## Our program:

- Me and my partner [Aahil](https://github.com/The007Programmer) worked on a project to help local businesses and restaurants in the San Francisco Chinatown as part of our submission for this hackathon!

- Our program is intended to utilize the many security cameras present in San Francisco to create a real-time heat/density map of the population in the area. This data will then be sent to local business owners that opt-in to our service. They may use this data to improve marketing, change open hours, or set dynamic prices (i.e. more people interested = higher price).
